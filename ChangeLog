        The average speed (CPS and CPM) in a lesson won't be counted until

1999-05-25  Ragnar Hojland Espinosa <ragnar@lightside.ddns.org>

	* Released version 1.4, aka Mad Merger Release


1999-05-21  Tijs van Bakel  <smoke@casema.net>

	* dvorak7min.c: added new features:
	Added color support thanks to superior planning by avoozl and zarq.
	Nastiness mode's CPS hitratio mayhem is now also taken into account.
	Support for bigger displays (looks nicer in Xterm)  Also added an
	optional visual bell.
	
	(myGetch): here one can see how bored i got.
	There now is some stupid Artificial Intelligent typist active.

	(do_text): fixed a bug with nastiness mode.. one could cheat and
	score very high by just having a key pushed down. a cure for gpm
	will not be found though

	(initApp): added checks to see if the screensize fits for a game.
	
	
1999-05-20  Ragnar Hojland Espinosa <ragnar@lightside.ddns.org>

	* Released version 1.3, aka Windscreen Squashed Bug Release

	Fixed a couple of missing breaks inside main, as reported by
	Mat Davis <matdavis@UU.NET>

	Added -k, --hidekeys  which hides the keyboard layout.  Mat
	mentioned he hid it to encourage memory, so I guess there can
	be more people who find it useful.

	Hid the hardware cursor, which was more an annoyance than anything
	else.
	

1999-02-28  Ragnar Hojland Espinosa <ragnar@lightside.ddns.org>

	* Released version 1.2, aka No Longer 7 Minutes Release

	Makefile options strike again! MUAHAHAHA.. ahem.  They actually define
	the defaults, which is more convenient than having to specify command
	line options each time, and doesn't take yet another ~/.dotrc file

	importText and related functions have somewhat improved error
	handling and reporting.  As well, it will handle more flexibily
	screen sizes over 80x25.

	The cps and cpm on screen are now Real Realtime On Screen (tm) ;).

	Minor/Cosmetic fixes:
	  - some int types have been changed to time_t
	  - added showHelp
	  - you no longer need to have a importText length limit


1999-02-11  Tijs van Bakel  <smoke@casema.net>

	* Makefile (INSTALL): all weird options are now commandline options

	* dvorak7min.c (importText): added a function to read ascii files
	no more need to train on lesson 27 ! :) go get some Gutenberg books.
	Most of the weird characters are skipped and simple wrapping is done.

	(main): added getopt functions to parse --version and --help strings.
	Useful now dvorak7min understands ascii-file-importing too :)

	(do_text): added Realtime On Screen cps and cpm.
	This makes my heart beat even faster when I make those stupid errors
	when trying to beat my old record on #29 :)

	(menuInteractive): changed this functions name to fit in an option
	to skip the menu and type on a ascii file directly.


1999-01-31  Ragnar Hojland Espinosa <ragnar@lightside.ddns.org>
       
       * Released version 1.1, aka Smoky Release

	Minor bugfixes: 
	  - space at EOL works properly now
	  - removed some apparently useless curses calls some people had 
	    problems with (Frank D Anconia <frank.d.anconia@usa.net>)
	  - added a makefile option to turn beeps off
	  - dvorak7min.c size is nicely a magic number (8192 bytes)
 	  - other little thing I don't remember
	

1999-01-28  Tijs van Bakel <smoke@casema.net>

	* dvorak7min.c: re-indented the source.
	put the lessons in a separate lessons.c file.

	(choose): it's now visible what the Nastiness value is set to.

	(do_text): wait for ESC key so the results are not skipped
	accidently.

	(boxed): changed the layout of the keyboard when TRY_TO_BE_PRETTY
	is not turned on.

	(do_text): see (boxed) below, changed highlighting
	(show_layout): see (boxed) below, changed highlighting
	(boxed): now requested keys are highlighted as well, so a user
	knows where about he should search for the next key :)

	* lessons.c (lessons): removed a few stupidity lines from
	lesson number 29, which is the only lesson I work on :)
